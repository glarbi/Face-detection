# Face-detection
In the field of security, motion detection remains a research area despite the evolution it has known since its creation. A surveillance camera can recover any type of movement. The movement that interests us in this project is the movement of human beings. The camera should only detect the movement of human beings. This detection is based on facial recognition techniques.
